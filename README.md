Werken
=====

Werken is a gearman server written in Erlang.  Werken means "work"
in Dutch, which seemed appropriate.

Getting started
---------------
Check out the Makefile for the different things you can do.  The easiest way to get up and running is by running the included shell script:  ```start.sh```.  This will compile a release and drop you into an erlang console.

A few notes
---------------
* This is my first real Erlang project.  I'm sure the code is wildly inefficient, and completely non-idiomatic.  Constructive criticism is appreciated.
* This code was written and tested against Erlang R16B. Earlier versions may or may not work.
